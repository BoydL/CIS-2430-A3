Assignment 3
cis 2430

In this assignment I used the previous example code given out for assignment two for the bases of the program
for the gui to attach to. 

In this assignment: A fully functioning gui which has every required 3 options in the command drop down menu at the
top left. by clicking on add, search, or quit it will switch to the appropriate JPanel for add and search and prompt
the user if they would like to exit before exiting, if quit is selected. In the drop down menu for type: there are
three options School, Home, Other. If other is selected the loction label and text field are visible, otherwise it 
is not visible. Both the add and search panel are fully functional and should be able to handle errors approproiatly.


Extras: -added in JOptionPane message boxes for errors and prompting on exit.
-Buttons and fields are easily accessable do to their size.
